            <div class="about-me-content">My name is Trevor Trammell, but my nickname to most of my friends and on the internet is Ragereous. Currently living in north-east Ohio, I love traveling whenever and wherever I can. I've been a nerd/geek for as long as I could remember, so I figured making a career out of it seemed natural. Bringing passion and dedication to the things I love is a standard, software development being one of them. Whenever I'm not working, you can find me playing a video game, or working on a nerdy endeavor.</div>
            <h3 class="about-me-tech-heading">Tech Stack</h3>
            <div class="about-me-tech-content">C# • .NET Core • Active Server Pages / ASP.net • JavaScript • Flexbox • MVC • HTML • CSS • Grid • TDD • Agile (Scrum) • Object Oriented Programming (OOP) • AJAX • JSON • React • Restful APIs • Responsive Design / Mobile • Structured Query Language (SQL) • Relational Databases / MS SQL • Source Control / GitHub</div>
            <div class="about-me-statement">I take pride in being a Full-Stack Developer. I love challenges, and learning a full tech stack gives me that. Being versatile applies to my personal and professional life.</div>

                    <h3 class="project-title">Weather Project</h3>
                    <p class="project-desc">This project is a fully functioning web application in .NET Core MVC, allowing a user to enter their address and retrieve a specified weather forecast for up to seven days and nights. This connects to two APIs, using HttpClient, transferring data between the two to finally display the results into an MVC-View.</p>

                    <h3 class="project-title">Gamer Blog Project</h3>
                    <p class="project-desc">Being a nerd, when asked to design an MVC CRUD website, I naturally decided: "How can I make this as cool as possible?" This cool website tracks reviews/blogs posts from a blogger, allowing them to display video game categories, and each category has a plethora of blogs about a specific game related to that category. If that wasn't enough, the blogger can create new blogs under the respective categories, edit, and delete them at will. Neatly stored into a backend SQL database, it responds quickly and has a cool visual design to boot.</p>

                    <h3>Rogue Simulator</h3>
                    <p class="project-desc">You must be learning the pattern here. This is a deceivingly simple console application designed around the concept that you're a rogue completing missions. I wanted to focus on keeping the code as clean as possible while showing off the fundamentals of OOP- APIE. Code is encapsulated as much as possible, using methods to reduce the visualization of another developer reading the code. Methods/variables are descriptive in their function to tell the story of his this project works.</p>
