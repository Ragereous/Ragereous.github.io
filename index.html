            <p class="bio-container">My name is Trevor Trammell, but my nickname to most of my friends and on the internet is Ragereous. Currently living in north-east Ohio, I love traveling whenever and wherever I can. I've been a nerd/geek for as long as I could remember, so I figured making a career out of it seemed natural. Bringing passion and dedication to the things I love is a standard, software development being one of them. Whenever I'm not working, you can find me playing a video game, or working on a nerdy endeavor.</p>
            <h3 class="tech-stack-heading">Tech Stack</h3>
            <p>C# • .NET Core • Active Server Pages / ASP.net • JavaScript • Flexbox • MVC • HTML • CSS • Grid • TDD • Agile (Scrum) • Object Oriented Programming (OOP) • AJAX • JSON • React • Restful APIs • Responsive Design / Mobile • Structured Query Language (SQL) • Relational Databases / MS SQL • Source Control / GitHub</p>
            <p>I take pride in being a Full-Stack Developer. I love challenges, and learning a full tech stack gives me that. Being versatile applies to my personal and professional life.</p>
